Just started hacking a bit with tRPC and Next 13. Don't share this repo.


## Overview

- `/@trpc/*` represent an imaginary trpc lib for Next 13
- See the [Issues](https://github.com/trpc/next-13/issues) for things I want us to hack on
- If you're invited here, feel free to add whatever you want to get a feel of Next 13 + tRPC combo
- Deployed at [rsc.trpc.io](https://rsc.trpc.io/)
